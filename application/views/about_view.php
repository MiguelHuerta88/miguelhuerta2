    <div class="about-me-column">
        <p>Hello everyone, this is the about me page where you can get a little bit more information about me.
        As stated in the home page my name is Miguel Huerta and I recently graduated from CSUDH. I decided to 
        add some quick links to the top of the page to make navigation easier.</p>

            <h4><a name="education">Education</a></h4>
            <p>I graduated from Carson Seinior High School in 2006. Right after High School I decided to enroll into 
            community college. Living in Carson California, I had a few choices to chose from. In the end I decided 
            to attend El Camino College located in Torrance, California. I remained at El Camino until 2011 while also 
            working with my father in his gardening service. In the Fall of 2011 I transferred to California State University,
            Dominguez Hills.</p>

            <h4><a name="elcamino">El Camino College</a></h4>
            <p>My time at El Camino College was great. For most of my time there I was working on finishing up my General Education 
            requirements so I could transfer to another school. My first Computer Science course was an Intro. To Computer Science and 
            Problem Solving. The programming language we learned to use was C++. At first the course was hard to follow, but as the time passed
            I started to really understand everything that was being taught. In this course we also learned to how use Visual Studios to compile
            and run our projects. In this course I learned the basics of C++, such as loops,functions, arrays and many more topics. We had around
            8 different projects, each dealing with the current topic being learned in lecture. The course finished off by learning about structs
            and classes.</p>
            
            <p>My second course Data Structures, also used C++ as the main programming language for the course. This course expanded on what we had learned
            in the introductory course. In Data Structures we started by reviewing classes, then moved on to dynamic memory, recursion, list, linked list,
            stacks, searching algorithms and graphs and trees. This course also assigned a project for each major topic covered in class. In
            the end we had a total of 9 different projects each covering a different topic. </p>
            
            <p>The next semester I decided to take an Introduction to Java Programming. This course was similar to my first introductory course in C++ but in
            Java instead. We learned about variables, functions, arrays, creating GUI, some differences between Java and C++ and many more topics. Each 
            project added a new element that we had just learned about in class. In the end our final product was a banking program that had a user interface,
            the capabilities to save, load, and also display your account balances. </p>

            <h4><a name="csudh">CSUDH</a></h4>
            <p>In the Fall of 2011 I began working towards my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. For the first three semester I was in the honor roll, receiving
            only A's and B's in all my courses. Each semester I will learn a new tool that I could take with me to the field. I learned assembly language one 
            semester along with Java. The next semester I took a stats course and computer networks. Each semester I would always be learning more and more.
            In the end for my Senior Porject I decided to put everything that I had learned into one project. I decided to make a project to help my father
            manage all his customers. The project was able to add new customers, edit, delete and search for customers. I also made it possible to keep track
            of when each customer would pay, so as the checks came in the mail I would record the date. Another feature I made sure to include was to be able
            to print monthly bills and also mailing labels. This project not only helped my mom with her monthly routines but it also gave me the opportunity
            to put everything I learned into one big project. </p>

            <h4><a name="programming">Programming Languages</a></h4>
            Some of the programming languages that I learned in school were
            <ul>
                <li>C++</li>
                <li>C </li>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>Assembly Language</li>
            </ul>
            I also read many books while on vacation from school. These are some more languages I learned
            <ul>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>PHP</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>Javascript/JQuery</li>
                <li>Android</li>
                <li>Python</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I also took a course in Database Management. This course was a course I really enjoyed because we learned how to design a project
            using databases correctly. We learned about relationships, built-in functions, procedures, users, the syntax to create, insert, update and delete.
            The course introduced MySQL, SQL and Oracle 11g. We had group projects that allowed us to select the relation database of our choice to
            complete the project.</p>

            <h4><a name="job">Job Experience</a></h4>
            <p>For most of my time in community college and also Cal State Dominguez Hills I was helping my father. I would go help my father in the morning
            and then go to class at night. In wasn't until my senior semester at CSUDH that I got accepted for a summer internship with the Department of Justice.
            The internship was only for 10 weeks with the possibility of staying longer. During my time their I developed a python script that would take a generated
            text report and split the report into smaller parts. Each part was then converted to PDF and placed in it's appropriate directory based on the title 
            of the report. This was the only programming I did during my internship. Most of the time I would basically be working with Excel.</p>
            
            <p>The next semester at CSUDH I became a Java Tutor and also an assistant for a professor. Each Wednesday I would go to the Java 2 course and help
            out the students with their problems. I was there to help guide them in the correct direction when trying to solve the problem. I would try not to give too 
            much of the answer away so that the students could solve the problem on there own.</p>
            
            <p>That winter break in when I applied at my current job, Internet Brands. My time at Internet Brands has been great and I really learned many new 
            things. My whole time at IB I worked along side my manager to help develop an Analytics tool that the company could use. Up to this point we have
            really created an amazing tool that is being used daily by the project managers. A more in depth description is given under the 
            <a href="<?php echo site_url('project')?>">projects page</a></p>

            On my spare time I enjoy riding my bicycle around town and taking in the view. I try to meet up with a group of friends each Thursday and ride around
            different areas of Los Angeles. Each week we try to go to a different destination. At times we might feel like doing a bit of climbing, other days we might 
            want to keep it easy. It all depends on the mood of the group.
